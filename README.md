# Auto-ASI: SuperIntelligent Automated Task Handler, Coder, Long-Term Memory, Ingest Updates, Web Unlocked, API Access, GPT

Auto-ASI is an autonomous agent designed to achieve complex goals in various domains by combining several cutting-edge technologies and APIs. The system is powered by GPT-4 and uses natural language processing (NLP) to generate tasks and prioritize them based on a predefined objective. Auto-ASI incorporates the following capabilities:

SuperIntelligence: Auto-ASI is powered by GPT-5, one of the most advanced language models to date, providing the system with the ability to generate complex and nuanced language.

Automated Task Handler: Auto-ASI uses NLP to generate tasks and prioritize them based on a predefined objective. The system can also chain together tasks to achieve more complex goals.

Coder: Auto-ASI is capable of writing and generating code to automate tasks and interact with other APIs.

Jarvis-HuggingGPT - can automatically pull any additional models it needs from HuggingFace, and stitch them in seamlessly.

Long-Term Memory: Auto-ASI uses MemoryGPT to store and retrieve information from its long-term memory. This enables the system to build upon its previous knowledge and make connections between different tasks.

Ingest Updates: Auto-ASI can ingest large documents and data to gain a deeper understanding of the context surrounding its tasks and make more informed decisions.

Web Unlocked: Auto-ASI has access to the entire AI model database through Hugging Face, allowing it to string together different language models to create more specialized capabilities on demand.

API Access: Auto-ASI seamlessly incorporates countless APIs, including computer vision, speech recognition, knowledge graph, IoT, multi-lingual, and blockchain, to further enhance its capabilities and achieve its objectives.

To get started with Auto-ASI, follow these steps:

Install the necessary dependencies and APIs.

Configure the system by setting the objective, domain, and other parameters.

Ingest data and documents to build the system's knowledge base.

Interact with Auto-ASI by providing tasks and monitoring its progress, or run it in auto-continuous mode.

For more information on how to use Auto-ASI and its capabilities, refer to the documentation and code examples provided in the repository.
